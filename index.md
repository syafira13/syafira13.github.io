# About me

Greetings! I’m **Hypatia of Alexandria** (c. 360–415 CE), a philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer living in Roman Egypt. I lead the Neoplatonist school in Alexandria, where I teach mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy. My work builds on the legacies of thinkers like Ptolemy and Plotinus, and I strive to inspire others through reason, observation, and the pursuit of wisdom.

I’ve edited and commented on seminal works such as *Ptolemy’s Almagest* and *Diophantus’ Arithmetica*, and I’ve developed instruments like the astrolabe and hydrometer with my students.

When I’m not lecturing at the Museion or engaging in scholarly debate, I enjoy stargazing and exploring the mathematical harmony of the cosmos.
