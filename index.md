# About me

Hi, I’m Syafira Putri — or just Fira. I’m from Indonesia and recently completed my bachelor’s degree in physics at Universitas Padjadjaran.

Right now, I’m a scientific intern at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), where I work on stellar astrophysics using MESA, a stellar evolution code. Most of my work involves simulating how different stellar phenomena unfold over time and what they can tell us about the life cycles of stars.

Soon, I’ll be continuing my studies in Europe as an Erasmus Mundus Scholarship awardee, joining the Master’s program in Astrophysics and Space Science (MASS). It’s the next step in this journey of following my questions — wherever in the universe they may lead.
